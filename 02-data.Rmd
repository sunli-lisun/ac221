- **Resolved Rate**: Number of resolved cases divided by total number of requests. The resolved cases are identified from 'closure_reason'. 

- **Awaiting Time**: Time period between open time and closed time of a request which is 'closed_dt' - 'open_dt'. 

- **Number of Requests  Per Capita**: Total number of requests in a neighborhood accumulated by four years divided by the population of that neighborhood. Population data will be described below. 

## Demographic Data

Demographic related data grouped by neighborhoods, including race, per capita income, education level, poverty rate, is also downloaded from  [**City of Boston 's open data hub**](https://data.boston.gov/dataset/neighborhood-demographics) compiled by Boston Planning and Development Agency (BPDA). Since cencus data is not collected in every year, 2015-2019 dataset is the most recent available 5-year American Community Survey (ACS) neighborhood demographic data. The demographic data is joined with 311 requests dataset by neighborhood.
