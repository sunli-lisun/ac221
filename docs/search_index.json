Issues such as potholes, dirty streets, broken street lights, and graffiti can be reported to the City by telephone, Twitter, web, or an app. Upon receiving a request, the City opens a case, assigns a case manager, and manages the issue through resolution. Progress and results are documented in a Constituent Relationship Management system, and made available to the public through the City’s open data portal, Analyze Boston. Citizens are more likely to file 311 reports if 1) they have high levels of trust in city government, 2) they have time on their hands, 3) they have highly visible issues in their communities, 4) they consider 311 to be the best recourse to address their problems. These characteristics are likely to vary across individuals and communities due to historical and cultural factors. The case management and response process may be affected by historical bias. Some citizens’ or communities’ problems may be taken more seriously due to their status within society. Thus, this study combines the 311 service request datasets with demographic data, such as income, education level, poverty rate, race distribution, poverty rate, to answer the question: Does Boston provide 311 services fairly and equally to all citizens?

The datasets includes all channels of engagement in which a service request is crated from year 2018 - 2021. In total, there are 1,047,926 cases. Below is the table of variables in this data set.

The close cases are identified from ‘case status’. Resolved Rate: Number of resolved cases divided by total number of requests. The resolved cases are identified from ‘closure_reason’. Awaiting Time: ‘closed_dt’ - ‘open_dt’. Number of Requests Per Capita: Total number of requests in a neighborhood divided by the population of that neighborhood. Population data will be described below. 2.2 Demographic Data Demographic related data grouped by neighborhoods, including race, per capita income, education level, poverty rate, is also download from City of Boston ’s open data hub compiled by Boston Planning and Development Agency (BPDA). Since cencus data is not collect in every year, 2015-2019 is the most recent available neighborhood demographic data come from the 5-year American Community Survey (ACS). Below is the table of variables in this data set. The dempgraphic data is joined with 311 requests dataset by neighborhood. "],["exploratory-data-analysis.html", "Chapter 3 Exploratory Data Analysis 3.1 Longitudinal Analysis 3.2 Distribution Analysis across Neighborhood 3.3 Demographic Analysis", " Chapter 3 Exploratory Data Analysis 3.1 Longitudinal Analysis We first examine the time trend of the request number in four years. The graph below shows a seasonality trend in each year, where it increases first, peaks in summer season, then decreases. We can also notice that there is a sharp drop in request number in week 10 to week 15 of 2020. A possible explanation would be the start of Covid-19 which leads citizens to stay at home and make less requests. 3.2 Distribution Analysis across Neighborhood 311 Report Request Number in Different Neighborhood The map intuitively shows that 311 report request numbers vary a lot geographically (please go to jupyter notebook to view the interactive version). The northern part is yellower than the southern part which indicates that citizens in the northeastern part generates more requests than the citizens in the southwestern part. In order to quantitatively compare the request numbers in every neighborhood, a bar plot is further generated. Dorchester is the neighborhood that has the largest number of requests followed by Roxbury and South Boston/ South Boston Waterfront. They all located in the middle or the northern part of the previous map. In contrast, Chestnut Hill, Mission Hill, and Fenway/ Kenmore/ Audubon Circle/ Longwood are the neighborhoods with lower than of request numbers. Those neighborhoods are located in the western part. We further normalized the number of 311 Reports by the population of that neighborhood. In all neighborhoods, 311 reports per capita are all greater than 1. Number of requests per capita is the highest in Downtown/ Financial District, followed by Beacon Hill and Back Bay. Misson Hill, Allston/ Brighton, and West Roxbury have relatively low request number per capita. Dorchester, which has highest request number, doesn’t have high report number per capita. 311 Requests by Different Channels across Neighborhood There are six channels that citizens could use to report their requests. After grouping the requests by neighborhoods, Heatmap is used to show the distribution of number of requests from different channels. The graph shows that there are slightly difference in the distribution of channels of different neighborhoods. Though the most commonly used channels are citizens connect APP and 311 phone calls, some neighborhoods (e.g. Back Bay, South Boston/ South Boston Waterfront) use APP more often, but some neighborhoods (e.g. Chestnut Hill, Greater Mattapan) use phone call more often. Distribution of Close Cases in Different Boston Neighborhoods Most neighborhoods have close rate higher than 85%. Chestnut Hill, Fenway/ Kenmore/ Audubon Circle/ Longwood is the only neighborhood has close rate (81.21%) lower than 85%. Beacon Hill has the highest closed rate (91.55%), followed by South End (91%) and East Boston (90.37%). Distribution of Resolved Cases in Different Boston Neighborhoods From the graph above, Greater Mattapan and West Roxbury are the two neighborhoods that have non_resolved cases numbers higher than resolved cases numbers which indicates the resolved rate is lower than 50%. Among the other neighborhoods, South End (59.44%) and Alluston/ Bringhton (58.57%) have relatively high resolved rates; whereas, Fenway / Kenmore / Audubon Circle / Longwood (51.01%), Mission Hill (51.46%), Boston (50.67%) have relatively low resolved rates. Distribution of Average Awaiting Time in Different Boston Neighborhoods On average, people need to wait at least a week for a case to be closed except in Chestnut Hill which might due to the extreme low number of cases. South Boston/ South Boston Waterfront, South End, and Roxbury have relatively short waiting time compared to Hyde Park, Charlestown, and West Roxbury where people need to wait longer. 3.3 Demographic Analysis Race Distribution Description: Race distribution of each neighborhood is significantly different. Black is dominant in Dorchester, Hyde Park, Greater Mattapan, and Roxbury ; whereas White is dominant in South Boston/ South Boston Waterfront, South End, Jamaica Plain, and Allston/ Brighton. East Boston is the only neighborhood that Hispanic has the largest proportion. Education Level Distribution Description: Distribution of education Level is different from each neighborhood. From easy visualization and comparison, education level is further categorized to two categories - below bachelor and bachelor or higher. The proportion of bachelor or higher is higher than below bachelor in the majority of neighborhood except for Hyde Park, East Boston, Greater Mattapan, and Roxbury. Though the proportion of bachelor or higher people is higher in Dorchester and East Boston, the difference between these two group is small. Income Distribution Description: Per capita Income is significantly different in each neighborhood. The per capita income of Back Bay is the highest, and it is the only neighborhood having per capita income larger than 100,000. The per capita income of Beacon Hill and South Boston/ South Boston Waterfront are also relatively high. The per capita income of Longwood, Roxbury and Mission Hill are lower than 25,000 which are the lowest among all neighborhoods. Poverty Distribution Description: Distribution of poverty rate is different from each neighborhood. Ferway/ Kenmore/ Audubon Circle/ Longwood is the neighborhood with the highest poverty rate (39.2%), followed by Mission Hill, Roxbury and Longwood. All of these neighborhood have porverty rate larger than 25%. On the other side, West Roxbury has the lowest poverty rate (6.3%), followed by North End and Beacon Hill. The poverty rates of these neighborhood are all lower than 8%.
