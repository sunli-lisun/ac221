Issues such as potholes, dirty streets, broken street lights, and graffiti can be reported to the City by telephone, Twitter, web, or an app. Upon receiving a request, the City opens a case, assigns a case manager, and manages the issue through resolution. Progress and results are documented in a Constituent Relationship Management system, and made available to the public through the City’s open data portal, Analyze Boston. Citizens are more likely to file 311 reports if They have high levels of trust in city government They have time on their hands They have highly visible issues in their communities They consider 311 to be the best recourse to address their problems These characteristics are likely to vary across individuals and communities due to historical and cultural factors. The case management and response process may be affected by historical bias. Some citizens’ or communities’ problems may be taken more seriously due to their status within society. Thus, this study combines the 311 service request datasets with demographic data, such as income, education level, poverty rate, race distribution, poverty rate, to answer the question: Does Boston provide 311 services fairly and equally to all citizens?

The datasets includes all channels of engagement in which a service request is crated from year 2018 - 2021. In total, there are 1,047,926 cases. Below is the table of variables in this data set.

The close cases are identified from ‘case status’. Resolved Rate: Number of resolved cases divided by total number of requests. The resolved cases are identified from ‘closure_reason’. Awaiting Time: Time period between open time and closed time of a request which is ‘closed_dt’ - ‘open_dt’. Number of Requests Per Capita: Total number of requests in a neighborhood accumulated by four years divided by the population of that neighborhood. Population data will be described below. 2.2 Demographic Data Demographic related data grouped by neighborhoods, including race, per capita income, education level, poverty rate, is also downloaded from City of Boston ’s open data hub compiled by Boston Planning and Development Agency (BPDA). Since cencus data is not collected in every year, 2015-2019 dataset is the most recent available 5-year American Community Survey (ACS) neighborhood demographic data. The demographic data is joined with 311 requests dataset by neighborhood. "],["exploratory-data-analysis.html", "Chapter 3 Exploratory Data Analysis 3.1 Longitudinal Analysis 3.2 Distribution Analysis across Neighborhood 3.3 Demographic Analysis", " Chapter 3 Exploratory Data Analysis 3.1 Longitudinal Analysis We first examine the time trend of the request number in four years. The graph below shows a seasonality trend in each year, where it increases first, peaks in summer season, then decreases. We can also notice that there is a sharp drop in request number in week 10 to week 15 of 2020. A possible explanation would be the start of Covid-19 which leads citizens to staying at home and making less requests. 3.2 Distribution Analysis across Neighborhood 311 Report Request Number in Different Neighborhood The map intuitively shows that 311 report request numbers vary a lot geographically (see jupyter notebook for interactive version). The northeastern part is yellower than the southwestern part which indicates that citizens in the northeastern part generate more requests than the citizens in the southwestern part. In order to quantitatively compare the request numbers in every neighborhood, a bar plot is further generated. Dorchester is the neighborhood that has the largest number of requests followed by Roxbury and South Boston/ South Boston Waterfront. They are all located in the middle or the northern part of the previous map. In contrast, Chestnut Hill, Mission Hill, and Fenway/ Kenmore/ Audubon Circle/ Longwood are the neighborhoods with lower request numbers. Those neighborhoods are located in the western part. We further normalize the number of 311 Reports by the population of that neighborhood. In all neighborhoods, 311 reports per capita are all greater than 1. Number of requests per capita is the highest in Downtown/ Financial District, followed by Beacon Hill and Back Bay. Misson Hill, Allston/ Brighton, and West Roxbury have relatively low request number per capita. Dorchester, which has the highest request number, does not have high report number per capita. 311 Requests by Different Channels across Neighborhood There are six channels that citizens could use to report their requests. After grouping the requests by neighborhoods, heatmap is used to show the distribution of number of requests from different channels. The graph shows that there are slightly difference in the distribution of channels of different neighborhoods. Though the most commonly used channels are Citizens Connect APP and 311 phone calls, most neighborhoods (e.g. Back Bay, South Boston/ South Boston Waterfront) use APP more often, but there are still several neighborhoods (e.g. Chestnut Hill, Greater Mattapan) that use phone call more often. Distribution of Close Cases in Different Boston Neighborhoods Most neighborhoods have close rate higher than 85%. Fenway/ Kenmore/ Audubon Circle/ Longwood is the only neighborhood has close rate (81.21%) lower than 85%. Beacon Hill has the highest closed rate (91.55%), followed by South End (91%) and East Boston (90.37%). Distribution of Resolved Cases in Different Boston Neighborhoods From the graph above, Greater Mattapan and West Roxbury are the two neighborhoods with non_resolved case numbers higher than resolved case numbers which indicates the resolved rate is lower than 50%. Among the other neighborhoods, South End (59.44%) and Alluston/ Bringhton (58.57%) have relatively high resolved rate; whereas, Fenway / Kenmore / Audubon Circle / Longwood (51.01%), Mission Hill (51.46%) and Boston (50.67%) have relatively low resolved rate. Distribution of Average Awaiting Time in Different Boston Neighborhoods On average, people need to wait at least a week for a case to be closed except in Chestnut Hill. This might due to the extreme low number of cases which bias could be introduced. South Boston/ South Boston Waterfront, South End, and Roxbury have relatively short waiting time compared to Hyde Park, Charlestown, and West Roxbury where people need to wait longer. 3.3 Demographic Analysis Race Distribution Race distribution of each neighborhood is significantly different. Black is dominant in Dorchester, Hyde Park, Greater Mattapan, and Roxbury ; whereas White is dominant in South Boston/ South Boston Waterfront, South End, Jamaica Plain, and Allston/ Brighton. East Boston is the only neighborhood that Hispanic has the largest proportion. Income Distribution Per capita Income is significantly different in each neighborhood. The per capita income of Back Bay is the highest, and it is the only neighborhood having per capita income larger than 100,000. The per capita income of Beacon Hill and South Boston/ South Boston Waterfront are also relatively high. The per capita income of Longwood, Roxbury and Mission Hill are lower than 25,000 which are the lowest among all neighborhoods. Education Level Distribution Distribution of education level is different from each neighborhood. For easy visualization and comparison, education level is further categorized to two categories - “below bachelor” and “bachelor or higher”. The proportion of’ bachelor or higher’ is higher than ‘below bachelor’ in the majority of neighborhoods except for Hyde Park, East Boston, Greater Mattapan, and Roxbury. Though the proportion of people with “bachelor or higher” degree is higher in Dorchester and East Boston, the proportion differences between these two groups are small. Poverty Distribution Distribution of poverty rate is different in each neighborhood. Ferway/ Kenmore/ Audubon Circle/ Longwood is the neighborhood with the highest poverty rate (39.2%), followed by Mission Hill, Roxbury and Longwood. All of these neighborhood have porverty rate larger than 25%. On the other side, West Roxbury has the lowest poverty rate (6.3%), followed by North End and Beacon Hill. The poverty rate of these neighborhoods are all lower than 8%.

If the number of 311 reports per capita in a neighborhood is high, this demonstrates that people in that neighborhood are more willing to communicate and interact with the city office on average. Summary: A regression analysis shows that the variance in 311 reports per capita is associated with demographic characteristics such as income, race, and education (p &lt; 0.01, 0.1, 0.05 respectively). Significance: Given that 311 services need to be requested to be provided, we can assume that neighborhoods with more 311 requests per capita will receive disproportionate benefits from city services compared with those that file fewer requests per capita (assuming all requests are attended to equally and the feasibility of resolving requests doesn’t vary across neighborhoods). Importantly, these results demonstrate an inversion of the socially desirable allocation of resources, whereby needy neighborhoods would be the ones receiving the most support from city services. In our case, it seems like a reasonable assumption that less well-off neighborhoods are the ones that are most in need of the services offered through 311 (e.g. repairs, cleaning, beautification, maintenance etc.), but it is well-off neighborhoods that are receiving disproportionate benefits from 311 based on their higher propensity to seek services. Interpretation: There are many possible explanations for this finding. People in less well-off neighborhoods may file fewer 311 requests per capita due to a lack of awareness of 311 services, mistrust of government, less leisure time to file cases, language barriers, or preference for local community-oriented problem solving rather than reliance on city government. 4.1.2 Close rate, Resolved Rate, Awaiting Time Across Different Neighborhoods In this section, we explore whether there are differences in close rate, resolved rate and awaiting time across different neighborhoods by calculating correlation and applying linear regression. 4.1.2.1 Race Table 4.1: Correlation between Response Metrics and Race Close rate Resolved Rate Average awaiting time White proportion 0.050764 0.197647 -0.145470 Black proportion -0.163486 -0.335092 0.167532 Statistically, there is no significant relation between close rate, resolved rate and awaiting time and racial structure within neighborhood from the p-value of three corresponding regressions and correlation values. Recap from the previous section, the average awaiting time of all neighborhoods is between 7 days and 12 days (except Chestnut Hill because of the extremely small sample size). Long awaiting time can happen in any neighborhood no matter whether the majority is the White or the Black. For example, in Hyde Park, proportion of the Black is obviously higher than other races, while in West Roxbury, proportion of the White is much higher than other races. Also, short awaiting time can appear in neighborhoods with any racial structure. For example, Dorchester and Allston/Brighton are Black and White dominated respectively but the average awaiting time are both around 9 days. Therefore, there is no obvious evidence showing racial discrimination in processing 311 requests. 4.1.2.2 Income Table 4.2: Correlation between Response Metrics and Income Close rate Resolved Rate Average awaiting time Per capita income 0.359678 0.369287 -0.323304 Based on the p-value from regression relation and the correlation coefficients between three response metrics (closed rate, resolved rate and awaiting time) and per capita income, there is no significant relation between income and all three response metrics. Recap that there are only three neighborhoods with close rate higher than 90%: Beacon Hill, East Boston and South End. However, the per capita income in Beacon Hill almost triples the per capita income in East Boston. Combined with the plot of awaiting time in different neighborhoods, the awaiting time in Back Bay and West Roxbury are both high but the per capita income in Back Bay almost doubles the per capita income in West Roxbury. Therefore, the relation between per capita income and fairness in processing 311 request is not obvious from the given information. 4.1.2.3 Education Level Table 4.3: Correlation between Response Metrics and Education Level Close rate Resolved Rate Average awaiting time Proportion of bachelor or higher 0.158577 0.264236 -0.204174 We cannot conclude that there is a significant relationship between education level and close rate/ resolved rate or awaiting time from regression results and correlation coefficients. Ferway/ Kenmore/ Audubon Circle/ Longwood is the only neighborhood with close rate lower than 85% but the population with bachelor degree or more is the absolute majority in the neighborhood. Recap that Mattapan and West Roxbury are the two neighborhoods with resolved rate lower than 50%, but proportion of bachelor or higher people in West Roxbury is much higher than that in Mattapan. For awaiting time, neighborhoods that have longer awaiting time and neighborhoods with shorter awaiting time can have similar education level structure. For example, the proportion of people with bachelor degree or more is high in both Charlestown and South Boston/ South Boston Waterfront, but the average awaiting time in Charlestown is nearly 12 days compared to the 7 days in South Boston/ South Boston Waterfront. 4.1.2.4 Poverty Rate Table 4.4: Correlation between Response Metrics and Poverty Rate Close rate Resolved Rate Average awaiting time Poverty rate -0.42111 -0.073302 0.000929 Similar with education level, there is no significant relationship between poverty rate and close rate/ resolved rate/ awaiting time from the linear regression results and correlation coefficients. Both Neighborhoods with low poverty rate and neighborhoods with high poverty rate can have high close rate. For example, the poverty in Roxbury (0.33%) is much higher than that in West Roxbury (6%), but the close rate in Roxbury (89%) is higher than that in West Roxbury (85%). As for resolved rate, there are neighborhoods with high poverty rate (such as Roxbury) that have high resolved rate, but there are also neighborhoods with low poverty rate (such as South Boston/ South Boston Waterfront) that have high resolved rate. The poverty situation in neighborhoods that have longer awaiting time is also a mix. Citizens in Fenway/ Kenmore/Audubon Circle/ Longwood (neighborhood with highest poverty rate) and West Roxbury (neighborhood with lowest poverty rate) both need to wait a long time. 4.1.2.5 Summary For all four demographic factors: population, income, poverty and education level, there are no obvious relationship with response metrics. Although differences could be observed in these three metrics across neighborhoods, demographic factors are not explainable for these differences and we cannot tell any demographic discrimination in processing 311 requests. There might be other factors served as confounding variables that could cause the differences in response metrics. 4.2 Fairness Analysis Based on Channel 4.2.1 Number of Requests by Channel vs.Closed rate, Responsed Rate, Awaiting Time From the heatmap across different channels above, the channel usage across neighborhoods are different. Therefore, further exploration based on channel could be carried out to analyze fairness. First, we compare the response metrics in each channel. We mostly focus on connect App and constituent call as they are the most commonly used channels. Summary: From this portion of our analysis, we can see that there are significant differences in our response metrics based on which channel a 311 request is filed through. The differences between “Constituent Call” and “Citizens Connect App” are the most important, as these two channels are used by citizens in 83% of all cases filed (46% app, 37% call). Significance: In terms of outcomes, the app appears to be a better channel for filing cases. Cases filed through the app have a significantly shorter waiting time than cases filed over the phone (7.6 days compared to 11.3 days), a much higher resolved rate (61% compared to 42%), and a higher close rate (90% compared to 85%). We suspect these differences are due to the amount and quality of information collected through each channel. The app collects useful data that does not come through phone requests, such as photos and geo-coordinates. The app also provides a more consistent, form-based structure for information gathering, whereas phone requests are more conversational. As a result, cases filed through the app may be easier for case workers to scope, understand, locate, and resolve. Implications: These findings may have important implications on the fairness of Boston’s 311 services. If app usage varies across neighborhoods, some may end up receiving better service than others (i.e. faster response time, higher resolution rate, more case closure). It would be more troubling if app usage were to correlate with neighborhood-level demographic characteristics such as race, income, and education. The next section explores these questions. 4.2.2 App Usage vs. Demographic Information Neighborhood-level app usage First, we find that there is a large amount of variance in app usage by neighborhood. Some, such as South End, have more than 60% of their cases filed through the app, while others, such as Greater Mattapan, have roughly 20%. Based on our previous analysis, we would expect those neighborhoods with higher app usage to receive better services. Demographic Differences More concerning is the association that app usage has with demographic characteristics in each neighborhood. Neighborhoods that are richer, whiter, and more educated have significantly higher rates of app usage (p &lt; 0.01 for per capita income and education, p &lt; 0.05 for whiteness), suggesting that well off neighborhoods are more likely to receive fast and effective service by virtue of their higher propensity to use the app. Possible Explanations: The differences in app usage and its correlation with neighborhood-level demographic characteristics may be due to several factors. First, citizens in well-off neighborhoods may be more likely to have smartphones. Second, they may be more aware of the Citizen Connect App due to marketing or word of mouth. Third, they may belong to demographic groups that would have an easier time using the app effectively (e.g. younger, more tech-savvy, and higher english proficiency). The 311 phone service may be comparatively attractive to citizens who don’t have access to the app or prefer the phone line due to technological or language constraints. Recommendations: The city should aim to equalize its service provision across neighborhoods by expanding app usage into less well-off neighborhoods and improving case outcomes from phone requests. This effort should involve Studying why discrepancies in channel usage exist Making an effort to raise awareness and adoption of the Citizen Connect App Ensuring equal accessibility on both the app and phone line (e.g. any language offered on the phone line should be supported by the app) Streamlining the data collection and case resolution process for phone requests. "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 5 Conclusion 5.1 High-Level Trends &amp; Insights 5.2 Fairness &amp; Bias 5.3 Limitations 5.4 Recommendations 5.5 Open Questions and Further Analysis", " Chapter 5 Conclusion 5.1 High-Level Trends &amp; Insights From the longitudinal analysis, there is a noticeable seasonality pattern in the request number, which increases first, peaks in summer and then decreases. A sharp drop of the request number occurred in the early stage of 2020 when the Covid-19 started. From the distribution analysis across neighborhood, the number of requests across neighborhoods vary a lot. Citizens in the northeastern part of Boston generally produce more requests than citizens in the southwestern part as shown in the heat map. When normalizing the number of 311 requests by the population, the number of 311 requests per capita are all greater than 1, and the distribution of 311 reports per capital is different from the distribution of absolute request numbers across neighborhoods. As for request channels, two most commonly used channels in most neighborhoods are ‘Citizens Connect APP’ and ‘Constituent Call’. The distribution of close cases vary in different Boston neighborhoods, and most neighborhoods have close rate higher than 85%. The distribution of resolved cases and average awaiting time in different neighborhoods are also different. On average, it takes at least one week before the case is closed. From the demographic analysis, the distributions of race, income, education and poverty level in each neighborhood are significantly different. 5.2 Fairness &amp; Bias While we find it unlikely that there is any explicit bias in Boston’s 311 service provision (e.g. intentional prioritization of well-off neighborhoods or witholding of services from needy ones), we find discrepancies along demographic lines in the way the service is used, making it likely that neighborhoods do not receive equal treatment from city government through 311. Neighborhoods that are whiter and more well-off tend to file more 311 reports per capita, suggesting that their residents receive disproportionate attention, resources, and benefits from the city through 311 service provision. Less well-off neighborhoods presumably have a greater need for 311 services, so this imbalance should be corrected by the city to mitigate inequality in living conditions between the most and least well-off areas. Additionally, our analysis suggests that whiter and more well-off neighborhoods have a stronger preference for using the Citizen Connect App compared to their less well-off counterparts, which increases the likelihood that their cases are solved quickly and successfully. These factors, taken together, provide strong evidence for the existence of conditions leading to unequal outcomes along demographic lines, and a logical explanation for how it might occur. Simply put, residents of whiter and more well-off neighborhoods are more likely to benefit from 311 services due to disproportionate usage of the system through more effective channels. 5.3 Limitations Our ability to detect bias in the dataset is limited by the granularity of demographic data we were able to match to reported cases. The 311 dataset does not have any personal details attached to cases, so all demographic data in our analysis was aggregated to the neighborhood-level. This prevented us from making any direct assessments on representation bias and individual treatment according to demographic factors. Our neighborhood-aggregated data may have obscured important insights we could not access at the individual level. For example, individual-level detail may have revealed which demographic groups within each neighborhood were filing 311 cases. Perhaps it was only the poorest quartile in each neighborhood using 311 - in that case, our concerns about the association between neighborhood-level income and reports per capita would be unwarranted. Perhaps certain demographic groups were underrepresented in case reports - in that case the city might want to consider intentional efforts to expand usage withon those subgroups so that their needs are being addressed. 5.4 Recommendations Given our findings, we believe the City of Boston can improve the efficiency and fairness of its 311 service by undertaking the following measures: Allocating more resources toward 311 case resolution during the seasonal peaks. Researching barriers to 311 access and usage - the city must understand why usage varies so much by neighborhood, and why demographic characteristics are associated with different levels and patterns of 311 usage. Equalizing case resolution by request channel - citizens should not be at a disadvantage based on their preferred channel for interacting with city government. The city should first analyze why outcomes are so much better when cases are filed through the app and subsequently close the gap. This might involve streamlining the information intake process over the phone, adding more languages to the app, or other operational improvements. Increasing awareness and adoption of 311 services among the neediest communities. This may involve targeted marketing, partnering with community based organizations, and overcoming trust barriers preventing communities from turning to the government to solve their problems. 5.5 Open Questions and Further Analysis Future research can look into whether disparate outcomes exists when controlling for the type of case that people file with 311. Some types of cases, such as pothole repair, are probably more complicated and time consuming than others, such as needle pickup. Our findings of discrepancies across neighborhoods along demographic lines may be influenced by the types of cases that get filed in different neighborhoods. For example, if low-income neighborhoods tended to file complex cases, it would not be a surprise to see longer waiting times and lower resolution rates. More analysis on background and historical conditions in Boston could explain differences in the willingness to use 311 and the effectiveness of the service. It could also shed light on sources of historical bias that continue to affect interactions between city government and its residents.
