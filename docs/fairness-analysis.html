<p>First, we analyze the interaction level with the city office in each neighborhood, which can be indicated by the number of reports per capita in each neighborhood. If the number of 311 reports per capita in a neighborhood is high, this demonstrates that people in that neighborhood are more willing to communicate and interact with the city office on average.</p>
<center>
<p><img src="image/f-interaction.png" style="width:80.0%" /></p>
</center>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> A regression analysis shows that the variance in 311 reports per capita is associated with demographic characteristics such as income, race, and education (p &lt; 0.01, 0.1, 0.05 respectively).</p>
<p><strong>Significance:</strong> Given that 311 services need to be requested to be provided, we can assume that neighborhoods with more 311 requests per capita will receive disproportionate benefits from city services compared with those that file fewer requests per capita (assuming all requests are attended to equally and the feasibility of resolving requests doesn’t vary across neighborhoods).</p>
<p>Importantly, these results demonstrate an inversion of the socially desirable allocation of resources, whereby needy neighborhoods would be the ones receiving the most support from city services. In our case, it seems like a reasonable assumption that less well-off neighborhoods are the ones that are most in need of the services offered through 311 (e.g. repairs, cleaning, beautification, maintenance etc.), but it is well-off neighborhoods that are receiving disproportionate benefits from 311 based on their higher propensity to seek services.</p>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> There are many possible explanations for this finding. People in less well-off neighborhoods may file fewer 311 requests per capita due to a lack of awareness of 311 services, mistrust of government, less leisure time to file cases, language barriers, or preference for local community-oriented problem solving rather than reliance on city government.</p>

<p>Statistically, there is no significant relation between close rate, resolved rate and awaiting time and racial structure within neighborhood from the p-value of three corresponding regressions and correlation values. Recap from the previous section, the average awaiting time of all neighborhoods is between 7 days and 12 days (except Chestnut Hill because of the extremely small sample size). Long awaiting time can happen in any neighborhood no matter whether the majority is the White or the Black. For example, in Hyde Park, proportion of the Black is obviously higher than other races, while in West Roxbury, proportion of the White is much higher than other races. Also, short awaiting time can appear in neighborhoods with any racial structure. For example, Dorchester and Allston/Brighton are Black and White dominated respectively but the average awaiting time are both around 9 days. Therefore, there is no obvious evidence showing racial discrimination in processing 311 requests.</p>

<p>Based on the p-value from regression relation and the correlation coefficients between three response metrics (closed rate, resolved rate and awaiting time) and per capita income, there is no significant relation between income and all three response metrics. Recap that there are only three neighborhoods with close rate higher than 90%: Beacon Hill, East Boston and South End. However, the per capita income in Beacon Hill almost triples the per capita income in East Boston. Combined with the plot of awaiting time in different neighborhoods, the awaiting time in Back Bay and West Roxbury are both high but the per capita income in Back Bay almost doubles the per capita income in West Roxbury. Therefore, the relation between per capita income and fairness in processing 311 request is not obvious from the given information.</p>

<p>We cannot conclude that there is a significant relationship between education level and close rate/ resolved rate or awaiting time from regression results and correlation coefficients. Ferway/ Kenmore/ Audubon Circle/ Longwood is the only neighborhood with close rate lower than 85% but the population with bachelor degree or more is the absolute majority in the neighborhood. Recap that Mattapan and West Roxbury are the two neighborhoods with resolved rate lower than 50%, but proportion of bachelor or higher people in West Roxbury is much higher than that in Mattapan. For awaiting time, neighborhoods that have longer awaiting time and neighborhoods with shorter awaiting time can have similar education level structure. For example, the proportion of people with bachelor degree or more is high in both Charlestown and South Boston/ South Boston Waterfront, but the average awaiting time in Charlestown is nearly 12 days compared to the 7 days in South Boston/ South Boston Waterfront.</p>

<p>Similar with education level, there is no significant relationship between poverty rate and close rate/ resolved rate/ awaiting time from the linear regression results and correlation coefficients. Both Neighborhoods with low poverty rate and neighborhoods with high poverty rate can have high close rate. For example, the poverty in Roxbury (0.33%) is much higher than that in West Roxbury (6%), but the close rate in Roxbury (89%) is higher than that in West Roxbury (85%). As for resolved rate, there are neighborhoods with high poverty rate (such as Roxbury) that have high resolved rate, but there are also neighborhoods with low poverty rate (such as South Boston/ South Boston Waterfront) that have high resolved rate. The poverty situation in neighborhoods that have longer awaiting time is also a mix. Citizens in Fenway/ Kenmore/Audubon Circle/ Longwood (neighborhood with highest poverty rate) and West Roxbury (neighborhood with lowest poverty rate) both need to wait a long time.</p>

<p>For all four demographic factors: population, income, poverty and education level, there are no obvious relationship with response metrics. Although differences could be observed in these three metrics across neighborhoods, demographic factors are not explainable for these differences and we cannot tell any demographic discrimination in processing 311 requests. There might be other factors served as confounding variables that could cause the differences in response metrics.</p>

<p>From the heatmap across different channels above, the channel usage across neighborhoods are different. Therefore, further exploration based on channel could be carried out to analyze fairness. First, we compare the response metrics in each channel. We mostly focus on connect App and constituent call as they are the most commonly used channels.</p>
<center>
<img src="image/f-3bar.png" />
</center>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> From this portion of our analysis, we can see that there are significant differences in our response metrics based on which channel a 311 request is filed through. The differences between “Constituent Call” and “Citizens Connect App” are the most important, as these two channels are used by citizens in 83% of all cases filed (46% app, 37% call).</p>
<p><strong>Significance:</strong> In terms of outcomes, the app appears to be a better channel for filing cases. Cases filed through the app have a significantly shorter waiting time than cases filed over the phone (7.6 days compared to 11.3 days), a much higher resolved rate (61% compared to 42%), and a higher close rate (90% compared to 85%). We suspect these differences are due to the amount and quality of information collected through each channel. The app collects useful data that does not come through phone requests, such as photos and geo-coordinates. The app also provides a more consistent, form-based structure for information gathering, whereas phone requests are more conversational. As a result, cases filed through the app may be easier for case workers to scope, understand, locate, and resolve.</p>
<p><strong>Implications:</strong> These findings may have important implications on the fairness of Boston’s 311 services. If app usage varies across neighborhoods, some may end up receiving better service than others (i.e. faster response time, higher resolution rate, more case closure). It would be more troubling if app usage were to correlate with neighborhood-level demographic characteristics such as race, income, and education. The next section explores these questions.</p>
</div>
<div id="app-usage-vs.-demographic-information" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="4.2.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.2</span> App Usage vs. Demographic Information<a href="fairness-analysis.html#app-usage-vs.-demographic-information" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p><strong>Neighborhood-level app usage</strong></p>
<center>
<img src="image/f-bar.png" />
</center>
<p>First, we find that there is a large amount of variance in app usage by neighborhood. Some, such as South End, have more than 60% of their cases filed through the app, while others, such as Greater Mattapan, have roughly 20%. Based on our previous analysis, we would expect those neighborhoods with higher app usage to receive better services.</p>
<strong>Demographic Differences</strong>
<center>
<img src="image/f-channelreg.png" />
</center>
<p>More concerning is the association that app usage has with demographic characteristics in each neighborhood. Neighborhoods that are richer, whiter, and more educated have significantly higher rates of app usage (p &lt; 0.01 for per capita income and education, p &lt; 0.05 for whiteness), suggesting that well off neighborhoods are more likely to receive fast and effective service by virtue of their higher propensity to use the app.</p>
<p><strong>Possible Explanations:</strong> The differences in app usage and its correlation with neighborhood-level demographic characteristics may be due to several factors. First, citizens in well-off neighborhoods may be more likely to have smartphones. Second, they may be more aware of the Citizen Connect App due to marketing or word of mouth. Third, they may belong to demographic groups that would have an easier time using the app effectively (e.g. younger, more tech-savvy, and higher english proficiency). The 311 phone service may be comparatively attractive to citizens who don’t have access to the app or prefer the phone line due to technological or language constraints.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong> The city should aim to equalize its service provision across neighborhoods by expanding app usage into less well-off neighborhoods and improving case outcomes from phone requests. This effort should involve</p>
<ul>
<li>Studying why discrepancies in channel usage exist</li>
<li>Making an effort to raise awareness and adoption of the Citizen Connect App</li>
<li>Ensuring equal accessibility on both the app and phone line (e.g. any language offered on the phone line should be supported by the app)</li>
<li>Streamlining the data collection and case resolution process for phone requests.</li>
</ul>
